## Materials

<!-- TO DO add funding -->

#### [OBO Semantic Engineering Training](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/)

Open, online self-paced training materials on becoming an OBO Semantic Engineer. The materials in this course are all intended to be used for self-study. The materials are aimed at several different audiences including database curators, ontology curators, ontology engineers and developers, ontology pipeline specialists, semantic ETC engineers and software engineers.

**Funding:** The creation of this content was funded by the [Critical Path Institute (CPI)](https://c-path.org/).


#### [BD2K Open Educational Resources](https://github.com/OHSUBD2K/)

Open Educational Resources covering various topics in data science are available in the form of online materials that are available [here](https://github.com/OHSUBD2K/), that are freely available to educators and students.
This project was funded by an award to the [OHSU Library](http://www.ohsu.edu/library) and the [Department of Medical Informatics & Clinical Epidemiology (DMICE)](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/), as part of the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, with the goal of improving health research by training students and researchers to better utilize and generate knowledge from large biomedical datasets.

**Funding:** The BD2K OERs are funded by NIH grant # 1R25GM114820.

#### [BioData Club](https://biodata-club.github.io/)

BioData Club is an informal, on-campus meetup initiated by a group of Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) students, staff, and faculty.
We come together to share skills, ask questions, and learn new open research tools.
We believe anyone can learn to program and are happy to help you start from scratch!
Join us to write your first line of code, learn new data management and analysis skills, try your hand at teaching in an informal context - or just show up at our Hacky Hour co-working events to work on your own projects with company.

**Funding:** Sponsored by the OHSU Library and OHSU DMICE.

#### [BD2K Data Science Skills Courses](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/research/bd2k.cfm)

The OHSU BD2K Skills Courses provide a series of training opportunities for a variety of learners.
The individual offerings of the course were intended to progress from novice to expert.
For novice students, we explored the use of data science techniques throughout the research data and analysis lifecycle.
For advanced students, we have selected extremely challenging problems to promote new methodologies in big data science.

**Funding:** This project was funded by NIH grant # 1R25EB020379.
