My expertise, education, and enthusiasm span genomics, biocuration, knowledge representation, and data harmonization  – and developing software tools and standards to advance these fields. The major motivations for my research are, first, to leverage the wealth of comparative genomics knowledge I’ve acquired over the past 2 decades to advance our understanding of human health and disease with translational and integrative data science – we need ALL the organisms! – and second, continuously improving socio-technological practices to build and coordinate research communities in these fields of study. I have dedicated considerable effort towards building a body of work focused on developing and growing research communities and on developing the software tools & resources to democratize genomic and phenomic analysis and help these communities to better address their research questions.
I lead the Standards Core in the BRIDGE Center project of the NIH [Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Program](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai). I am the Program Director for the ["Phenomics First Resource"](https://tislab.org/research.html), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Genomic Science, and for the [Monarch Initiative](http://monarchinitiative.org/), the flagship Program of TISLab.
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics in the School of Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and a Program Director for the Translational and Integrative Sciences Lab (TISLab).
